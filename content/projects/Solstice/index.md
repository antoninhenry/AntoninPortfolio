## Survival FPS

Take your friends and your guns with you and try to survive as many waves as you can.

## Context

This little project is part of a 3 months course on **network** applied to gaming. We were a team of 3 people, and we learned to implement plugins for online features using `EOS (epic online services)`, such as login, lobby, sessions, leaderboards, achievements. It also allowed us to learn how to create a simple FPS character that can shoot, kill AI, pick up stuff, etc using `C++` and `blueprints` in `Unreal Engine`. The game is very prototypical and barely playable, nevertheless we learned a lot on online features and Unreal Engine.

## My job

We followed more or less the same lessons so some tasks were done by all the team. Anymay, I've build a C++ Unreal Engine FPS project from scratch, made an **interaction and online toolkit**, made the **raycast** and ammo mechanics, the input system, and many bug fixes.
