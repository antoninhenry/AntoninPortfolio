## Popularize AI

This serious game is aiming to popularize simple concepts of AI and to remove the mystique surrounding it. You have to fill the AI with data by playing a mini-game, if your patterns are optimal then you're good to go, if they're bad the AI will not be efficient or will completely ruin its path.

The intended audience is young people with an interest in IT, or older people not so familiar with new technologies.  

## Context

This project took place in a 3 months course in a team of 7 persons on **serious games**. We approached this project as a problem which needed research methodology, so we documented the state of the art, the intended audience with persona, procedures to test the game, design issues... The subject was set by the teacher : make a serious game on Artificial Intelligence.

## My job

I've done the entire mini-game, platform usage and player's performance calculation.
