## Popularize AI

This serious game is aiming to popularize simple concepts of AI and to remove the mystique surrounding it. You have to fill the AI with data by playing a mini-game, if your patterns are optimal then you're good to go, if they're bad the AI will not be efficient !

The intended audience is young people with an interest in IT, or older people not so familiar with new technologies.  

## Context

This project took place in a 3 months course in a team of 5 persons, where we were free to develop the game we wanted, as long as we used `Unity` and followed the **Time Loop** theme. This course also served as an introduction to the use of `Perforce` which is very valuable for the video game industry. Our team followed `Agile Scrum` management by using `Trello`.  

## My job

I've done all the mini-game, platform usage and performance calculation.
