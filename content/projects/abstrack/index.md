## Escape the chaos

In Abstrack, you are thrown away in a mysterious world where the environment is moving and an obscure force is blowing it apart.
It is chasing you and all you know is that you need to run away from this hostile entity making good use of the surroundings.

## Parkour

The game is filled with multiple unique levels where you can run, jump, crouch, slide, wallrun, climb and swing with your hook, in a first-person animated character.

## Context

This is my biggest project until this day, I've worked with 3 friends during 6 months on this parkour game focused on gameplay and immersion. We used `Unity3D` for this game, and this is part of a course on `Agile Scrum` management so we used `Trello` and self-organized, we also had reviews with the Product Owner (the teacher).

## My job

I've contributed to all of the character's **animation system**, the audio which is vital for a good immersion, mechanics related to character movement, abilities, saves, post-processing, on the **level design** with this minimal still chaotic and moving environment, and many other interesting stuff !
