## Be a virtual DJ

As a DJ, you'll have to liven things up and make the better sound possible through your virtual mixing desk. Mute the tracks you want, create a build-up, test the mixer effects such as distortion, reverb, filters and others, change the bpm... all that in a neon nightclub with synchronized visual effects.

## Context

We made this project in a team of 3 people. We used the `XR interaction toolkit` and tested the game with an `Oculus Quest II`. This **virtual reality** game is part of a VR course on 3 months, it is still in a prototypical state and some improvements can be done.  

## My job

I've contributed to the interaction system with the sliders, buttons, the separate audio tracks, and the implementation of the mixer effects.
