## Stuck in a time loop... for your good

The temple of the Turquoise Lord is hostile but you will find on your way tools to overcome its various challenges, like a bow, a shield, a mysterious sacrificial dagger that make a clone from your past appear... Maybe he can help your current self ? But you'll have to think. The puzzles become harder and harder as you progress in the temple.

## Context

This project took place in a 3 months course in a team of 5 persons, where we were free to develop the game we wanted, as long as we used `Unity` and followed the **Time Loop** theme. This course also served as an introduction to the use of `Perforce` which is very valuable for the video game industry. Our team followed `Agile Scrum` management by using `Trello`.  

## My job

I made all the **interaction system** which make it easy to build puzzles, I've contributed to some **animations** and 2D sprites using `Piskel`, I managed the respawn / death of the player, and I've done a part of the **level design**.
