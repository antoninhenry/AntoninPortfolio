## Physics Engine
`C++`

Project done with 4 other students at UQAC for a course on **mathematics** applied to **video game**. I've learned how to create a simple physics engine rendered with `OpenGL` by writing shaders and implementing the behaviour of mechanical and physical phenomenons such as particles, forces, rotations, collision detection, etc.

## Face AI
`Python`

Facial recognition app designed to help its user classify and analyze images. Fill the AI with a few photos of someone and the name corresponding, and it will be able to analyze other photos and identify this person. You can sort your library by the persons present in the photos. This project was made with 2 friends in a **software engineering** course and we produced the according documentation : **design, technical specifications, testing**. 

## MyBrain
`Java`, `Android`

Mobile app aiming to collect data on the brain reaction to different music with the help of an EEG. My 2 teammates and I created the app on `Android Studio` and designed a protocol to collect the data, but we had not the time nor the equipment to do the EEG part. The application uses `Spotify API` to play the tracks, and a server to send the questionnaire answers in which the participants share their opinion and how they feel about the music. My part of the job concerned mostly the **UI/UX** design, the spotify integration and building the questionnaire.
